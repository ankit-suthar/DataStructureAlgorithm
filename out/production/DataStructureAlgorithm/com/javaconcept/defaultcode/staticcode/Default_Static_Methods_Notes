The interfaces can have static methods as well which is similar to static method of classes.

Default methods of interface can be overriden.

Overriding default methods in class is optional, but if there are two interfaces and class is implementing both the interfaces in that case we have to
override default method and inside overrided method we have to write which method we want to make a call.

Default methods are accessed by using interface reference variable.

Static methods of interface cannot be overriden.

Static methods are accessed by Class reference only. (Interface.Static Method)

The default methods were introduced to provide backward compatibility so that existing intefaces can use the lambda expressions
without implementing the methods in the implementation class. Default methods are also known as defender methods or virtual extension methods.

Default methods were introduced to provide backward compatibility for old interfaces so that they can have new methods without effecting existing code.
